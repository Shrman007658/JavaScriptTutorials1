All of these files are html files.
Open the folder in your IDE and go through the html files.
These files are from a course in Udemy by Kalob Taulien : https://www.udemy.com/share/102gFoBEcbdVlaR34=/
You can refer to the courses there.
As I got the course for free I realized that you would benefit from the resources here.
If there is any doubt ping me up I will surely be able to help you.
